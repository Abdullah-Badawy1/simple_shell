.SH NAME
hsh \- The Holberton command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[file or arguments]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command language interpreter, known as a shell, that executes commands read from standard input or from a file. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for running commands and scripts.

.PP
A more detailed manual can be found within the provided documentation.

.PP
.I hsh
does not support complex option processing like more feature-rich shells such as bash or zsh.

.SS Overview
A shell is a command interpreter that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. It reads and processes commands entered by the user, then executes those commands. It plays a crucial role in managing and interacting with the system.

.B hsh
is the shell that runs when a user logs into the system, providing a platform to execute various commands and scripts.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument read from standard input is assumed to be the command, and following arguments are its parameters. To invoke a script or file, the first argument is assumed to be the filename; no other options are necessary.

.PP
.B hsh
reads and executes commands from standard input or the file, then exits.

.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.B Simple Command
is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words or redirectors, and terminated by a control operator. Blanks include new lines and tabs. The first word specifies the command to be executed and is passed as argument zero; the remaining words are passed as arguments to the command.

.PP
Comments can be added to standard input using the
.B #
symbol before any arguments or words to comment out.

.PP
.I Example:
.B
echo qwerty

.PP
This will only write "qwerty" to standard output.

.SH PARAMETERS
A parameter is an entity that stores values. It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters. A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.

.PP
.B Special Parameters
.PP
$Parameter

.PP
To view a list of all parameters and environmental variables, the builtin
.B env
is used. To view the value of a specific parameter, simply use
.PP
.B
echo $parameter
.PP
in the standard input.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked, it is given an array of strings called the environment. This is a list of name-value pairs in the form of name=value.

.PP
The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for export to child processes. Executed commands inherit the environment.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of an executed command is a numeric value that indicates the success or failure of the command. If a command succeeds, it typically returns 0. In case of failure, it returns a non-zero value.

.PP
The exit status of
.B hsh
itself is the exit status of the last command executed in the input. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.

.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
.B hsh
contains some builtin functions. These are listed below and do not support any flags.

.PP
.B env
.PP
Prints out a list of all shell variables. Each variable is separated by a new line, displayed as
.I key=value.

.PP
.I Example:
.B
env

.PP
This prints out all the environmental variables and their values.

.PP
.B exit
.PP
The exit command terminates the current shell (or script). The return status is the status of the most recently executed command (i.e., $?).
